# Build / Run

```java
Compile technically means translating one formal langurage to another.

For Programming Languages, it often means translating sourcecode into machine instructions.
However, notive Java is compiled into java bytecode.
and some compilers compile to some other language.

The key to compiling is language translation.
```

Run is the process of `executing a program`.
Build usually includes one or more compile steps and `once an application has been built it can be run`.
